Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

Introduction

For drivers and governments all around the world, saftey on the road is a major concern. Drivers wish to keep themselves safe, while governments do their best to mitigate the hazardous conditions that cause severe accidents. Using data analysis and machine learning algorithms, data will be explored to determine the conditions that most affect whether an acccident was severe, as well as to make predictions on the severity of an accident given the conditions. 

Data

The data from which we will derive these conclusions is a comprehensive collection of the conditions under which these accidents happen, the severity, and all other potential variables in question.

Methodology

First, I began with importing the data into the Jupyter Notebook. Next, I removed the columns that I suspected would have little to no impact on the overall accuracy of the learning algorithms. Next, all NaN values were removed along with standardizing the data to optimize the machine learning algorithms. Finally, both logistic regression and an SVM were used, with both scoring near perfect accuracy ratings on both the Jaccard and F1 tests.

Conclusion

With the data used to fit the models, we can reasonably within a 1% confidence predict the severity level of the car accidents.
